# devs
Short form for developers.

# coders
Alias for devs / developers.

# dependencies
A dependency is any software (tool or third party code) that our project needs in order to function.

# a hack
A crappy solution to an annoying problem that shouldn't even be there in the first place, or something like that.

# IDE
Integrated Development Environment. Everything you need a developer in one interface, split into multiple sections usually. 

# libraries

Not the kind where you check out books. In software, a library is a package of code that performs a specific function and can be used by other code.

# third party
Software that was written by someone else, not us or our team. It can be open source or proprietary (*shudder*).
