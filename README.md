Hello and thank you for joining us for the CUEBC Code Camp at Lighthouse Labs.

My name is Khurram Virani, co-founder of Lighthouse Labs. I'll be your host today. 

My background is in software development, focusing on web technologies. I started programming at a young age but I also started teaching computer use and coding at a very young age (eight, to be exact).

What else... I like video games and spicy food. I don't like spiders.

## Schedule

Okay so here's what our day today will _kind of_ look like:

* **10:00AM - 11:00AM:** Talk about HTTP, Cloud9, HTML & CSS
* **11:00AM - 12:00PM:** Breakout & Build (in pairs) - Part I
* **12:00PM - 01:00PM:** Working Lunch + Talk about JavaScript
* **01:00PM - 02:30PM:** Breakout & Build (in pairs) - Part II
* **02:30PM - 03:00PM:** Closing Talk

## Pair Programming

You're encouraged to buddy up with one other person. That said, both of you should ideally do the setup work individually on your own laptops. 

## The Goal

Today's goal is to get acquainted with JavaScript-based web programming by creating a simple chat application. We'll use modern tools and languages (Cloud9, NodeJS, jQuery, etc.) and touch upon many different aspects. 

The objective is not to _fully_ understand every line of code (though that would be nice), but rather understand the server-client architecture and more importantly to be inspired by how much can be created with such little code these days.

## The Product

The finished app that we'll be building in just a few hours today will look and feel much like this:

Cool, eh?

## Okay, so let's get started!

You may be tempted to start hacking away at code, but you can wait until 11AM, ie after the initial talk, can't you? please? #kthxbye
