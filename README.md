# Introduction

Hello and thank you for joining us for this JavaScript workshop at Lighthouse Labs.

My name is David VanDusen, Web bootcamp instructor at Lighthouse Labs. I'll be your host today. 

My background is in software development, focusing on Web technologies. I started programming at a young age and built websites during some of the most exciting times in the technologies' histories.

That said, I started out as a musician and fine artist. So, whatever we make today, let's make it pretty.

## Schedule

This is the plan for the day.

TODO: Fill this in.

## Pair programming

You're encouraged to buddy up with one other person. That said, both of you should ideally do the setup work individually on your own laptops. 

## The goal

Today's goal is to get acquainted with JavaScript-based Web programming by creating a simple chat application. We'll use modern tools and languages (Cloud9, Node.js, jQuery, etc.) and touch upon many different technologies. 

The objective is not to fully understand every line of code, but to understand the server-client architecture and to be inspired by how much can be created with so little code.

## The product

The finished app that we'll be building in just a few hours today will look and feel much like this.

## Let's get started!

You may be tempted to start hacking away at code, but you can wait until 11AM, ie after the initial talk, can't you? please? #kthxbye
