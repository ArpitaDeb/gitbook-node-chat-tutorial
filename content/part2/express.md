# Express, for easier HTTP

So far we've created a node script that prints something out to the terminal, which is great. Instead of doing that though, we need it to do something real.

In our case, we're building a web server, more specifically a _chat 'server'_. So we need to listen for incoming HTTP requests and then send down the HTML, CSS and JS that we wrote earlier for our _chat 'client'_.

While Node comes with basic HTTP handling support, a very (probably the most) popular 3rd party library (called "modules" in the Node community) named 'Express'. 

## DYK!!

**That reminds me!** Since you've made it to this point, I guess you deserve a really juicy bit of DYK (did you know).
