Javascript is a programming language used to build modern web applications and websites.

The reason we need to use Javascript is because it allows us to add logic to our page thus making it interactive.

For example, let's say we would like to show a loading image once a certain button has been clicked or loading more data in the background without refreshing the page.

All of these things are done with Javascript. The beauty in all of this is that recent developments have been made in Javascript realm which allow us to write JS code to interact with the backend as well (using NodeJS).
