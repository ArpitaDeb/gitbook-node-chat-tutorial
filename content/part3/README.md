# Enhancements as Challenges (Optional)

You may have noticed some bugs and broken features with this app:

## 1. Name field 

The name field (the first input box) is not being used at all. Modify the `app.js` so that it sends (emits) the text as something like `"KV says: hello"` where `"KV"` is from the first input field (with`id="you"`) and `"hello"` is from the message field.

## 2. Initial field

The name field is actually meant to be 2 letter initials only. Make it so only a maximum of two characters can be added on. 

Hint: google "html input field maximum length" for a convenient HTML attribute that can be added to yout HTML file.
