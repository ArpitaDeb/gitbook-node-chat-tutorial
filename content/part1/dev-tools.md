# Dev Tools

With your ugly white page open, right click somewhere on the page (anywhere, really) and you'll notice an inspect element option:

Note that I'm assuming that you're using Google Chrome, like a good dev should.

Clicking that unlocks a most powerful yet kind-of secret feature that all major browsers have: **Dev Tools** (aka a Web Inspector).

Hover over the HTML source code shown and notice that you can not only use it to inspect the page, but you can also edit it right there (double click the code) to see how it affects the page.

Our browser gives us a live editor! Why??? It's specifically there for developers to inspect ANY page on the internet, to see how it's HTML (and other things) are written.

That's right, you can use this to stea.... _borrow_ ideas and even their implementation from other websites. Cool, eh?

BTW any changes you make through this editor are just experiments and won't actually "stick". If you refresh the page the changes go away. They don't save into your source code directly.

Play around with it a bit more to get the hang of the "Elements" tab in the Dev tools.

Then select (click) the `<body>` tag and on the right side you'll see something like this:

Hmm... What's this? And what if I double click inside those weird sideways mustaches and type in the following:

Whoa! What was that? That my friend, was CSS. 

Boom! (Drops mic and walks off the stage).
