# Github

It's where the cool kids hang. 

[Github](https://github.com/) is where most of the open source code resides. Almost every software developer (whether they are web, mobile, desktop or other) has a Github account these days. It also has some great developer workflow features. 

You will need to sign up for a Github account. If you already have one, please log in.

# Git

Github is centered around an open source Version Control system (software) called Git. Git was created by the same dude that created Linux. He's kind of a big deal. And so is git.

It's like dropbox for coders. We need to make sure our project codebase is sync'd to a central server for not only backup purposes but also to share with other devs working on the same project. 

It gives us a lot more control than Dropbox though, and is not nearly as easy to use. That said, it's probably the most popular VCS today and continues to grow at a rapid pace, thanks to services like Github especially. 

If you were developing today's app using your own machine, you'd be installing git. But we've saved you that trouble, so no action required here. w00t!
