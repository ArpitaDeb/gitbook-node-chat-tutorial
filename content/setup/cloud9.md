# Cloud9.io

Cloud9 is amazing. It is for developers what Google docs is for MS Office. BTW if you still use MS Word and Excel instead of Google docs/drive for your spreadsheets and documents, you're living in the 2000s. All the cool kids are living in 2010s.

Anyway, so what is Cloud9? I'm not surprised you're asking. There are many devs out there that don't know about c9 just yet... Just like how MS Office is still widely used.

Here's the thing... it takes a lot of time and effort to setup your computer for writing software. A whole bunch of libraries and tools to install, and it's especially hard to make sure every developer on the same team has the exact same versions for all the dependencies.

This is big hurdle especially when getting started with code. Cloud9 gives us a pre-configured machine in the cloud as well as a really slick IDE right in the browser. As long as you have internet, you can immediately start coding like a real developer.
