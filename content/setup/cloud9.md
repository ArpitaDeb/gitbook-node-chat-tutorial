# Cloud9.io

Cloud9 (c9) is amazing. It is for developers what Google Docs is for Microsoft Office.

It takes a lot of time and effort to setup your computer for writing software. There are a whole bunch of libraries and tools to install, and it's especially hard to make sure every developer on the same team has the exact same versions for all the dependencies.

This is big hurdle especially when getting started with coding. Cloud9 gives us a pre-configured machine in the cloud as well as a really slick code editor right in the browser. As long as you have Internet, you can immediately start coding like a professional developer.

## Sign up

We're all going to use the same c9 account to save us time signing up for our own accounts. Login with the credentials you were shown.

Once you've done that, create a new workspace titled "chat-app-YOUR-NAME". You can keep it public and select "Blank" as the type.

At this point c9 will open a new browser tab and launch the editor. You're all set to start working on our app!
