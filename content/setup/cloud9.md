# Cloud9.io

Cloud9 (c9) is amazing. It is for developers what Google docs is for MS Office.

It takes a lot of time and effort to setup your computer for writing software. There are a whole bunch of libraries and tools to install, and it's especially hard to make sure every developer on the same team has the exact same versions for all the dependencies.

This is big hurdle especially when getting started with coding. Cloud9 gives us a pre-configured machine in the cloud as well as a really slick IDE right in the browser. As long as you have Internet, you can immediately start coding like a _Real Developer_&trade;.

## Sign up

So with that said, go ahead and [sign up for a c9 account on their website](https://c9.io/web/sign-up/free). _Use your github profile_ to sign up.

Once you've done that, create a new workspace titled "chat-app". You can keep it public and select "Blank" as the type.

At this point c9 will open a new browser tab and launch the editor. You're all set to start working on our app!
